Before we dive into data types, I would like to take a moment to explain what SQLite is and how it differs from traditional databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. More specifically, we will look at the differences in data types between SQLite and other databases.

## What is SQLite?

SQLite is a lightweight, self-contained database engine known for its simplicity and portability. Unlike MySQL and PostgreSQL, which use a client-server model, SQLite works directly with a single database file on disk. This design removes the need for server management, making it easy to set up and maintain.

While SQLite supports standard SQL, it differs from other databases in how it handles data types.

### Dynamic Typing in SQLite

SQLite uses dynamic typing, meaning it doesnâ€™t strictly enforce data types on columns. This allows storing any value, like a string, in an `INTEGER` column which is something not allowed in databases with static typing, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL.

For example, the SQL statement below is perfectly valid in SQLite:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  age INTEGER
);

-- Although the `age` column is `INTEGER`, it can
-- store a string because of dynamic typing.
INSERT INTO users (id, name, age)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'Twenty Five');
```

If you run the following SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

The output will be:

| id  | name     | age         |
| --- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1   | John Doe | Twenty Five |

For more details, check the [SQLite data types](https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html) and [why it uses dynamic typing](https://www.sqlite.org/flextypegood.html) in the official documentation.

### Static Typing in Other Databases

Databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL use static typing, which enforces data types when columns are created. This means a column defined as `INTEGER` can only store numeric values, not strings.

If we run the above example in MySQL we will get an error:

```
ERROR 1366 (HY000) at line 9: Incorrect integer value: 'Twenty Five' for column 'age' at row 1
```

Since SQLite has different typing rules compared to other databases, I would recommend using an online service like [SQLFiddle](https://sqlfiddle.com/) or [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/) to test out the examples in the next two lessons about data types.
