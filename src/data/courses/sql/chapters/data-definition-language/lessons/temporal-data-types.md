Temporal data types are used to store date and time data. These are one of the most important data types in SQL and understanding them is crucial for working with any application that needs to store time-based data.

Given below is the list of temporal data types in SQL with their sample usage:

| Category    | Description                                       | Example Usage                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `DATE`      | Stores only the date (year, month, day)           | Birth dates, holidays, deadlines |
| `TIME`      | Stores only the time of day                       | Store hours, appointment times   |
| `DATETIME`  | Stores both date and time                         | Event times, log entries         |
| `TIMESTAMP` | Similar to `DATETIME` but with timezone awareness | e.g. Calendar events             |

Let's explore each of these types in detail in the following sections.

### DATE

The `DATE` type is used to store date without any time information. It is perfect for situations where you only need to track the day something happened.

```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
  id INTEGER,
  title VARCHAR(100),
  publication_date DATE,
  reprint_date DATE
);

-- Insert a book record
INSERT INTO books (id, title, publication_date, reprint_date)
VALUES (1, 'The Great Adventure', '2023-05-15', '2024-01-01');

-- Select the book record
SELECT * FROM books;
```

When you insert or query date data, the format `YYYY-MM-DD` is used. This is the standard format for dates based on [ISO 8601 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) and it is used by most databases.

> Both MySQL and PostgreSQL allow you to use the format `YYYYMMDD` when inserting dates as well. You can read more about the date and time literals in the [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/date-and-time-literals.html) and [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-DATETIME-INPUT-DATES).

When you query the date data back from the database, you will get the date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` i.e.

| id  | title               | publication_date | reprint_date |
| --- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| 1   | The Great Adventure | 2023-05-15       | 2024-01-01   |

All the databases have formatting functions e.g. MySQL has `DATE_FORMAT` and PostgreSQL has `TO_CHAR` functions which can be used to format the date as per your requirement. For example, query below formats the date data to `DD-MM-YYYY` format.

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    title,
    TO_CHAR(publication_date, 'DD-MM-YYYY') AS publication_date
FROM books;
```

The output will be:

| id  | title               | publication_date |
| --- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1   | The Great Adventure | 15-05-2023       |

### TIME

The `TIME` type stores time-of-day values in the format `HH:MM:SS[.fraction]`. This is useful when you only need to track the time something occurs, regardless of the date.

```sql
CREATE TABLE bookstore_hours (
  day_of_week VARCHAR(10),
  opening_time TIME,
  closing_time TIME
);

-- Insert bookstore hours
INSERT INTO bookstore_hours (day_of_week, opening_time, closing_time)
VALUES
  ('Monday', '09:00:00', '18:00:00'),
  ('Tuesday', '09:00:00', '18:00:00');

-- Select the bookstore hours
SELECT * FROM bookstore_hours;
```

When you query this data back from the database, you will get the same format `HH:MM:SS`.

| day_of_week | opening_time | closing_time |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Monday      | 09:00:00     | 18:00:00     |
| Tuesday     | 09:00:00     | 18:00:00     |

### DATETIME/TIMESTAMP

Most of the databases support `DATETIME` and `TIMESTAMP` types. Both of these types store date and time data with some differences.

For example, MySQL supports both types:

| Type        | Description                                           |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATETIME`  | Stores both date and time                             |
| `TIMESTAMP` | Stores both date and time but with timezone awareness |

PostgreSQL doesn't have `DATETIME` but has:

| Type          | Description                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `TIMESTAMP`   | Stores both date and time                             |
| `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Stores both date and time but with timezone awareness |

Given below is the example of how to create a table with `TIMESTAMP` type in PostgreSQL. The query below however will work for any database that supports `TIMESTAMP` type.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id INTEGER,
  book_id INTEGER,
  order_time TIMESTAMP
);

-- Insert a book order (PostgreSQL)
INSERT INTO orders (id, book_id, order_time)
VALUES (
  1,
  101,
  '2024-03-15 14:30:00'
);

-- You can also use CURRENT_TIMESTAMP to get the current timestamp
INSERT INTO orders (id, book_id, order_time)
VALUES (
  2,
  102,
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Query the orders table
SELECT
    id,
    order_time
FROM orders;
```

The query might return:

| id  | order_time               |
| --- | ------------------------ |
| 1   | 2024-03-15T14:30:00.000Z |
| 2   | 2024-12-28T01:19:58.654Z |

Alright, now that we have seen the temporal data types, let's look at some common operations you might perform with temporal data.

## Common Operations with Temporal Data

Here are some common operations you might perform with temporal data in a bookstore:

### Difference between two dates

In MySQL, you can use the `DATEDIFF` function to calculate the difference between two dates. For example, given the following table:

| id  | title               | publication_date | reprint_date |
| --- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| 1   | The Great Adventure | 2023-05-15       | 2024-01-01   |

You can use the following query to calculate how long books have been in print:

```sql
SELECT
    title,
    publication_date,
    reprint_date,
    DATEDIFF(reprint_date, publication_date) as days_in_print
FROM books;
```

The output will be:

| id  | title               | publication_date | reprint_date | days_in_print |
| --- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| 1   | The Great Adventure | 2023-05-15       | 2024-01-01   | 231           |

### Getting the Month of Sales

Given the following `sales` table:

| id  | customer_name | book_id | sale_amount | sale_date  |
| --- | ------------- | ------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 1   | John Doe      | 101     | 100.00      | 2024-01-01 |
| 2   | Jane Smith    | 102     | 150.00      | 2024-02-15 |
| 3   | Alice Johnson | 103     | 200.00      | 2024-03-20 |
| 4   | Bob Brown     | 104     | 120.00      | 2024-04-25 |
| 5   | Carol Green   | 105     | 180.00      | 2024-05-30 |

You can use the following query to get the month of sales:

```sql
SELECT
    customer_name,
    DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%M') as month,
    sale_amount
FROM sales;
```

The output will be:

| customer_name | month    | sale_amount |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| John Doe      | January  | 100.00      |
| Jane Smith    | February | 150.00      |
| Alice Johnson | March    | 200.00      |
| Bob Brown     | April    | 120.00      |
| Carol Green   | May      | 180.00      |

### Getting Sales for a Specific Dates

You can use the `WHERE` clause and perform range queries on the date column. For example, given the following table:

| id  | customer_name | book_id | sale_amount | sale_date  |
| --- | ------------- | ------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 1   | John Doe      | 101     | 100.00      | 2024-01-01 |
| 2   | Jane Smith    | 102     | 150.00      | 2024-02-15 |
| 3   | Alice Johnson | 103     | 200.00      | 2024-03-20 |
| 4   | Bob Brown     | 104     | 120.00      | 2024-03-25 |
| 5   | Carol Green   | 105     | 180.00      | 2024-03-30 |

You can use the following query to get the sales for March 2024:

```sql
SELECT
    customer_name,
    sale_amount
FROM sales
WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2024-03-01' AND '2024-03-31';
```

The output will be:

| customer_name | sale_amount |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Alice Johnson | 200.00      |
| Bob Brown     | 120.00      |
| Carol Green   | 180.00      |

> Note: The exact syntax for temporal operations might vary between different database systems. Always consult your specific database's documentation for the most accurate information. Here is the [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/date-and-time-functions.html) and [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-datetime.html).

Feel free to go through the documentations above for different functions available for temporal data types. We will also look at more examples in the future lessons.
