As we discussed in the previous lesson, there are following four basic categories of data types in SQL:

| Category  | Description                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Numeric   | Used for storing numerical values     |
| Temporal  | Used for storing date and time values |
| Character | Used for storing text values          |
| Boolean   | Used for storing boolean values       |

We only covered some basic data types for each i.e.

| Category  | Data Types               |
| --------- | ------------------------ |
| Numeric   | `INT`, `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE` |
| Character | `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`        |
| Temporal  | `DATE`                   |
| Boolean   | `BOOLEAN`                |

In this lesson we will dive a bit deeper into each of these data types and cover some more advanced data types supported by MySQL (all of which have their equivalents in other databases as well).
